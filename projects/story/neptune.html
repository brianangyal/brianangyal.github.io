        <h2>Neptune: The Windy Planet</h2>
        <p id="neptune-desc">Neptune is the eighth and farthest known planet from the Sun in our solar system. It is notable for its strong winds and stormy atmosphere, with the fastest winds of any planet, reaching speeds of 2,100 km/h. The planet's deep blue color is due to the absorption of red light by methane in the atmosphere, and it has a series of faint rings around it.</p>
