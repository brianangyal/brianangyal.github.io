        <h2>Earth: Our Home Planet</h2>
        <p id="earth-desc">Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. About 29.2% of Earth's surface is land with the remaining 70.8% covered with water. It has a very diverse environment and climate, ranging from tropical climates near the equator to polar climates at the poles. Earth's atmosphere is rich in nitrogen and oxygen, and it has a strong magnetic field, which, along with its atmosphere, shields us from harmful solar radiation.</p>
