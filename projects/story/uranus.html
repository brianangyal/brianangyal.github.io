        <h2>Uranus: The Ice Giant</h2>
        <p id="uranus-desc">Uranus is unique for its sideways rotation and pale blue color. It's known as an ice giant due to its cold temperature and large size. The planet has a complex layered cloud structure, with water thought to form the lowest clouds, and a methane layer creating its faint blue color. Uranus has 27 known moons and a faint ring system.</p>
