        <h2>Pluto: The Dwarf Planet</h2>
        <p id="pluto-desc">Once considered the ninth planet, Pluto is now classified as a dwarf planet. It has a heart-shaped glacier, named Tombaugh Regio, which is the size of Texas and Oklahoma combined. Pluto has a thin atmosphere that expands when it comes closer to the Sun. It also has five known moons, with Charon being the largest.</p>
