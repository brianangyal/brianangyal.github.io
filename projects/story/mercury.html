        <h2>Mercury: The Swift Planet</h2>
        <p id="mercury-desc">Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system and the closest to the Sun. Its orbit around the Sun takes just 88 Earth days. Despite its proximity to the Sun, temperatures can be extremely low due to its thin atmosphere. Mercury has a rocky surface, similar to the Earth's moon, marked by craters and irregular terrain.</p>
